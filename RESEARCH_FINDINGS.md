# Research Findings — BTC Daily Strategy

Running log of honest out-of-sample conclusions. The governing rule: a strategy
is only "better" if it beats buy-and-hold robustly out-of-sample, selected
without peeking at the test window.

## Headline conclusion (as of the latest round)

**No strategy found so far robustly beats buy-and-hold on BOTH Sharpe and NAV.**
The vol-targeted trend ensemble offers genuinely lower drawdown (and higher
full-sample Sharpe), but it gives up NAV in bull markets, and on a year-by-year
basis buy-and-hold has the best risk-adjusted return.

## What works

- **Volatility targeting + diversified trend ensemble** — lower drawdown
  (-51% full sample vs buy-and-hold -83%), higher full-sample Sharpe
  (1.07 vs 0.99), positive Sharpe in every fixed window. Its weakness is NAV:
  vol-targeting trades away 2017-2021 bull upside for risk control.
- **No-trade band (fee control)** — raising the band 0.20 -> 0.30 cut trades
  ~44% and fees ~35% while *improving* validation Sharpe and holding drawdown.
  Trading less is materially better given the 0.5% per-trade fee. (0.40 cut more
  fees but blew full-sample drawdown out to -67%.)

## What does NOT work (tested, documented, not hidden)

- **Standalone next-day ML** (500 experiments): mean OOS test Sharpe -0.28;
  top-validation configs were test-negative (val 1.29 -> test -0.34). Of 36
  configs that beat buy-and-hold on test, zero had validation Sharpe > 0.7, so
  none were selectable without peeking.
- **ML gate hybrid** (round 2, 400 experiments): looked promising on the lumped
  test window (logistic/h20/on-chain gate: test Sharpe 0.80), but **year-by-year
  it is not robust** — mean yearly Sharpe 0.30 (worst of the three; buy-and-hold
  0.77, ensemble 0.57), with a catastrophic 2019 (-0.92). The aggregate test
  number was a single-window artifact. This is the key lesson: select on
  fold-by-fold robustness, not aggregate-window Sharpe.
- **Intraday daily-bar stops** — redundant with vol-targeting; BTC drawdowns are
  multi-day grinds, not single-day crashes a daily stop catches.
- **MVRV valuation gating** — 2024-2025 ran persistently high MVRV without a
  top, so de-risking exited a rising market.

## Methodology notes

- Year-by-year (per-fold) evaluation is mandatory before trusting any edge.
  Aggregate validation/test Sharpe hides window-composition luck.
- ML results are reproducible on MPS (identical across re-runs with fixed seeds).
- Full-sample Sharpe (rewards low drawdown) and mean-yearly Sharpe (rewards
  consistency) can disagree — report both.
